# BoneLab Level Utils
Utilities for bonelab levels. Player health options and waypoints!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Level Utils loads customized level properties from "\<Game directory\>\\UserData\\LevelUtils\\\<level pallet\>\\\<level barcode\>.json".<br/>
Options can be set using the in-game BoneMenu as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
# Setting up custom level properties
In-game, load the level you wish to add properties for.<br/>
Open up Menu->Preferences/Options->BoneMenu->Level Utils<br/>
Set the values as you prefer.<br/>
For waypoints, physically position yourself at the desired location, go to Waypoints->New Waypoint, and then select a color.<br/>
Once created, a waypoint's name, color, and position can be modified inside the level's JSON file (see above for location).<br/>
